# Push_swap

## Project Overview

The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project:data must be sorted.
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
This Project is written in C programming language.

## Algorithm Of Sorting

In this project I used the Longest increasing subsequences (LIS)
